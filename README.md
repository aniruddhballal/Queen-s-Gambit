# Queen's-Gambit
An app that makes use of chess pgn files to store, encrypt and decrypt data.<br>
(Additional feature to apply AES and DES to enhance security).
<br>.<br>
meh, gotta go type a better readme.md file.
<br>
note: this readme.md file is SO OUT OF DATE, i have made significant progress since then and i shall update this readme.md file soon
<br>.<br>
update: please check the project synopsis - it is somewhat doing what the readme file should do, but not really AND i do have to make a proper readme file for this project, BUT AGAIN im hoping that the comments in the latest version or the last two versions of the app are helpful enough for the reader/developer to understand it.
<br>.<br>
update2: v stands for version, and all versions flaunt new features - respective to their titles.
